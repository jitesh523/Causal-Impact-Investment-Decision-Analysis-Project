A comprehensive, end-to-end framework for measuring the **true financial impact** of marketing campaigns using **Bayesian causal inference**. This project moves beyond simple correlation to determine the *incremental* value driven by specific interventions.

## 📊 Executive Summary

This project implements a rigorous **Causal Impact Analysis** to evaluate a \$5,000 marketing campaign. Using **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS)** modeling, we compared the actual observed revenue against a counterfactual "synthetic" baseline.

### 🏆 Key Results

| Metric | Result | Interpretation |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Cumulative Revenue Impact** | **\$42,137.64** | Total additional revenue generated by the campaign |
| **Net Profit** | **\$37,137.64** | Profit after deducting campaign costs |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | **742.75%** | For every \$1 spent, the campaign returned \$7.43 |
| **Statistical Confidence** | **99.9%** | The result is highly significant (p < 0.0001) |

> **Business Verdict:** The campaign was a massive success, paying for itself **7.43 times over**. The intervention should be scaled immediately.

## 📈 Dashboard & Logic

### Interactive Dashboard
Explore the results interactively with our new Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard.py
```

**Features:**
- **Dynamic Scenarios:** What-if analysis with adjustable intervention dates
- **Segment Comparison:** Compare ROI across Channels, Countries, and Devices
- **Financial Reporting:** Automated business narrative generation
- **Export Capabilities:** Download charts and data directly

### Analysis Logic (8-Step Framework)
1.  **Data Acquisition**: 5,000+ user-level records
2.  **Intervention Definition**: Treatment vs. Control groups
3.  **Data Pipeline**: ETL processing and time-series aggregation
4.  **BSTS Modeling**: Bayesian Structural Time Series for counterfactuals
5.  **Results Interpretation**: Computing incremental lift
6.  **Financial Value**: Translating lift to $$$
7.  **Visualization**: Static plots and interactive dashboards
8.  **Validation**: Placebo tests and sensitivity analysis

## 🔬 Advanced Analytics Features

The project now includes advanced modules for deeper insights:

### 1. Robustness & Validation
- **Synthetic Control Method (`src/synthetic_control.py`)**: Alternative causal inference approach for validation.
- **Sensitivity Analysis (`src/sensitivity_analysis.py`)**: Tests how results change with different dates, parameters, and alpha levels.
- **Bayesian A/B Testing (`src/bayesian_ab.py`)**: Probabilistic testing for conversion rates (Beta-Binomial model).

### 2. Multi-Metric Analysis
- **Module:** `src/multi_metric_analysis.py`
- Analyzes impact beyond revenue: **Conversions, Clicks, Impressions, User Count**.
- Confirming that the campaign drove engagement across *all* funnel stages.

### 3. Long-Term Effects
- **Module:** `src/decay_modeling.py`
- Models the **exponential decay** of campaign effects post-intervention.
- Estimates the "half-life" of the marketing impact.
